## 📌 About the Internship

During my internship at Tata Power Renewable Energy Limited, I worked on building an ML-driven system to analyze solar inverter performance across a fleet. The goal: predict efficiency from operating conditions, detect anomalous inverters, and quantify the financial impact of efficiency loss in ₹ — enabling proactive maintenance and ROI decisions.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Predict solar inverter efficiency from physical drivers (temperature, load, irradiance, weather, aging)
- Build a fleet-level anomaly detection system to flag underperforming inverters
- Quantify ₹ cost impact of efficiency loss, per inverter and fleet-wide
- Provide SHAP-based explainability for audit and decision-making
- Deploy a production-ready REST API and interactive dashboard

## 🗓️ Project Timeline

| Phase | Module | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Week 1 | Data & EDA | Physics-based synthetic data generation, feature engineering |
| Week 2 | Modeling | XGBoost + LightGBM, 5-fold CV, time-aware split |
| Week 3 | Explainability & Anomaly | SHAP analysis, Isolation Forest for fleet health |
| Week 4 | Deployment | FastAPI backend, Gradio dashboard, cost impact reporting |

## 📊 Results

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Test R² | **0.9004** |
| Test MAE | **0.0083** |
| 5-Fold CV R² | **0.9058 ± 0.0014** |
| Fleet annual loss detected | **₹5.55 Lakh** |
| Faulty inverters flagged | **3 of 10** |

| GET | `/fleet-health` | Fleet anomaly status |
| GET | `/cost-impact` | ₹ loss analysis |

## 🔍 Model Details

- **Algorithm:** XGBoost Regressor (400 trees, learning rate 0.05, max depth 6)
- **Features (14):** hour, month, is_monsoon, temperature, temp_roll3, temp_deviation, irradiance, irr_roll3, irr_per_temp, dc_power, load_ratio, load_x_temp, days_since_start, eff_lag1
- **Split:** 80/20 stratified by month
- **Validation:** 5-fold cross-validation
- **Explainability:** SHAP TreeExplainer

## 🚨 Anomaly Detection & Cost Impact

Isolation Forest on model residuals identified **3 faulty inverters** (INV-003, INV-007, INV-009) out of 10 with anomaly rates of 2–3.5% vs fleet baseline 1.5%.

Cost analysis (tariff ₹8/kWh, nominal efficiency 95%):
- **INV-003 (soiling):** ₹1.55 Lakh/year loss
- **INV-007 (aging):** ₹0.77 Lakh/year loss
- **INV-009 (sensor fault):** ₹0.81 Lakh/year loss
- **Fleet total:** ₹5.55 Lakh/year

## ⚠️ Data Note

Synthetic dataset generated using **IEC 61724 standards** and real inverter datasheet parameters (temperature coefficient -0.35%/°C, soiling model, monsoon adjustments). Production deployment requires SCADA integration — the pipeline is designed to be **swap-ready** with real CSV feeds.
